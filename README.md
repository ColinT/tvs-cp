# 2. Setup Channel Point Rewards

This project uses the **name** of the custom channel points rewards as the command to run. For example, a reward named `!donate` will activate the `!donate` command. You will have to create a separate reward for each command. You can find all the available commands in `commands.txt`.

I recommend enabling "Skip Reward Request Queue" so that the commands do not interfere with your other rewards.
